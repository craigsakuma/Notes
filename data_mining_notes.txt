Data Mining Notes

Data Mining in Practice by Junling Hu

- Pattern mining
- Machine learning
- Stream mining
- Recommender system
- Graph mining (e.g., internet)
- Unstructured data
    - Text
    - Audio
    - Image and Video

- 
- Product Assortment / Basket Analysis / Cross-selling
    - Beer and Pampers
    - Home Depot acquired data mining company for help with forecasting
- Click behavior
- Machine breakdown 
    - GE turbines
    - car insurance companies
- Product recommender
    - count frequency of co-occurence of products at Amazon
    - efficient algorithm is difficult when you extrapolate data 
- Customer churn
    - Identify customers likely to leave
    - Offer customer incentive to retain consumer (e.g., Tesco vs. Walmart customer centricity)
- Customer segmentation
    - Obama campaign to segment customers and market accordingly for fundraising
- Fraud Detection
- IT error log
- Customer Credit Risk Evaluation
    - Use neural networks
- Post Office - handwriting identification


- Neural networks
  - Processed one at a time


- Support Vector Machines
    - Spam filters

- Logistic Regression
    - can be parallelized

- Click prediction
    - Probability of clicking content or add (logistic regression?)

- Semi-supervised learning
    -Siri speech dialog system

- Unsupervised learning
    - Clustering
        - K-means clusters
        - Density based
        - Hierarchical

- Clustering applications
    - malware detection
    - document clustering for topic detection (google news)

- Recommendation Engines
    - Rating prediction - based on user's history, predict ratings for other products and then recommend top new products
    - Explicit vs. Implicit feedback (substitute page views, frequency, time of day during visit, length of visit, clicks, etc...)
    - Collaborative filtering
        - User-User similarity - Not very scalable for sites like Amazon that have too many users (pairwise comparison for 20M users would take a day of computing)
        - Item-Item similarity is replacing user-user similarity
        - SVD - Singular value Decomposition (reduce number of factors to simplify at small cost in accuarcy)
            - Summarize all factors in smaller number of latent factors
        - Ranking-based model - LinkedIn
