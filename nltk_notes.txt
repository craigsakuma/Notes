NLTK Notes


- Process
    - Select corpus
        - use stemming to clean corpus
        - remove stop words (NLTK has library)
    - Select terms
    - Calculate TF-IDF for each term
        - might need to add 1 to IDF to avoid dividing by zero

    - Use cosine similarity to measure similarity
- Limit cosine similarity to 300 words (becomes computationally expensive when >300)
- Beautiful Soup
    - Text extraction from html (even broken html)
- Stemming in NLTK isn't very good
- NLTK.clean_html() - cleans up html markers
- urllib2 for capturing html
- diffbot


- Mining the Social Web
- Dr. Matt
